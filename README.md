Hospitality - a limited functionality hospital reception application written
in NodeJs for Red Hat's OpenShift hackday - August 2016.


Starting the development server is as simple as `npm run devserve`. If you want
to specify your own env vars, it can be done in the .env file. Even if it's not
recommended to version the .env, this has been done for showcasing.

OpenShift specifics for deploying the application can be found (buildconfig,
etc.), can be found in the [OpenShift folder](openshift).
